<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

<h1>Old Solutions</h1>

Dependence on CCTV footage reviewed by security personnel.
A vast network of over 15,000 cameras across the southern provinces.
<h1>Identified Issues</h1>

Data storage challenges: Managing and analyzing large amounts of CCTV footage is resource-intensive.
Chanthaburi Police Database: Storing data on specific groups raises privacy concerns.
Databases of high-risk individuals and vehicles: Risk of misuse and potential for discriminatory practices.
Limited investigative tools: Traditional methods like witness testimony and forensic evidence are slow and often inefficient.
<h1>Goals for Improvement</h1>

Enhanced police efficiency: Provide training for officers to use AI-powered tools for crime data analysis and investigation on smartphones.
Increased public trust: Implement AI-powered CCTV systems to ensure transparent crime monitoring and evidence collection.
Real-time crime prevention: Develop AI systems that send alerts to police about suspicious individuals or vehicles through mobile devices connected to a central server.
<h1>Challenges to Address</h1>

System design: Developing a secure and effective system for crime prevention using AI technology.
Modern investigative knowledge: Incorporating AI tools into existing investigative practices while maintaining ethical data usage.
Understanding criminal behavior: Analyzing patterns and event sequences to effectively predict and prevent crime.
<h1>Methodology</h1>

Detection: AI algorithms will continuously analyze data from various stations to identify suspicious activities or known criminals.
Tracking: After a target is detected, the system tracks their movements across different stations, creating a visual trail.
Recognition: AI algorithms will compare detected individuals or vehicles with database records to verify their identity.
Alerts: If a match is found, an alert with relevant details (location, direction, criminal history) will be sent to police officers.
Response: Officers can use this information to efficiently apprehend suspects.
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

Improved police efficiency: AI-powered tools on smartphones will enable officers to analyze crime data efficiently, speeding up investigations and responses.
Enhanced crime prevention: AI-driven CCTV systems will allow real-time crime monitoring and evidence recording, boosting public confidence in security measures.
Proactive intervention: AI algorithms will analyze CCTV footage and other data sources to detect suspicious activities and send immediate alerts to police, allowing for rapid response to potential threats.
